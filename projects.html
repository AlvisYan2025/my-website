          <p class="project-detail"> The game is similar to what's called "Farkle", where players take turns to roll dices and one can choose how many times to roll. If the total points landed on a certain range, the player wins. If it exceeds the upper limit, the player loses. This program will keep playing this game with itself and learn through a simple supervised machine learning algorithm (Native Bayes) and gets better. You can choose to display each trace of the game.</p>
