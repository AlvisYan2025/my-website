                Hellooo! 
                My name is Haoyu(Alvis) Yan, an undergrad student at New York University. I'm majoring computer science and economics. As a software engineer, I'm mostly familiar with Python and Javascript, with proficiency in react.js, express, flask, and other commonly used tools in web development and software engineering. I'm also good at data analysis and statistics in economics. I'm ready to collaborate with teams of engineers and computer scientists and contribute to large projects/software products. Now seeking intern!
